Thought experiment for a system of open source architectural specifications. 

As with most software, we've moved from one time fees for services and content to subscription models. The same is true for architectural specifications. What used to be raw text that offices developed and used over and over again has turned into proprietary content that requires annual subscriptions to access. The benefit is updates and software that makes the creation of specifications easier to use. The downside is that it's now necessary to pay for this content continuously, much like the transition from creating drawings from pencils that were purchased once and used freely towards drawing software that is now required by offices and monopolized by corporations.

This proprietary specification content in a lot of ways is actually open knowledge. It is general information, although technical, and references publicly available building codes and material testing certifications. We're also dealing with commodities: concrete, lumber, steel, glass etc. Many of our building products have become more product than commodity over time, but companies readily provide specifications free to use. The caveat being that it's written for their products.

A few assumptions:
- That there would be the interest and energy in maintaining the core specification content.
- A growing trend of separating content from it's access and use (jamstack, headless cms, etc.).
- That there would be interest and potential profit in the creation of front-ends for the content.

# What is this really?
1. The first component is a repository of content, on github perhaps, that anyone can use, either by download for fetching that data.
2. The second is the aspiration that an open source, publicly maintained body of architectural content can be accessed by anyone that wants to build a frontend that allows end users to edit and manipulate the content. Developers are allowed to distribute their service for free or for a fee (one time or subscription model). Increased competition could create better ui/ux (most of them are pretty clunky), and lower pricing.

# An Analogy
Need to think of one...
